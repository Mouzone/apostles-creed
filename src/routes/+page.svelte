	<p>I believe in God,</p>
	<p>the Father almighty,</p>
	<p>Creator of heaven and Earth,</p>
	<p>and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,</p>
	<p>who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,</p>
	<p>born of the Virgin Mary,</p>
	<p>suffered under Pontius Pilate,</p>
	<p>was crucified, died and was buried;</p>
	<p>he descended into hell;</p>
	<p>on the third day he rose again from the dead;</p>
	<p>he ascended into heaven,</p>
	<p>and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;</p>
	<p>from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.</p>

	<br />

	<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit,</p>
	<p>the holy catholic Church,</p>
	<p>the communion of saints,</p>
	<p>the forgiveness of sins,</p>
	<p>the resurrection of the body,</p>
	<p>and life everlasting.</p>

	<br />
	<p>Amen.</p>
